# Target

Try to install CGAL_swig_bindings into python3, and then install it into sage.

# So far

- The bindings can be installed via ```python3 install setup.py``` into python3, but it can not be installed in the form of \
```pip3 install git+https://github.com/CGAL/cgal-swig-bindings.git@master```, whose format comes from [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20101834/pip-install-from-git-repo-branch).
