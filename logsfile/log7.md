# Target
- download the [cgal-bindings 1.2](https://pypi.org/project/cgal-bindings/#modal-close) and make it as a normal package.
- find the difference between the package of [cgal-bindings 1.2](https://pypi.org/project/cgal-bindings/#modal-close) and package of the official [cgal-swig-bindings](https://github.com/CGAL/cgal-swig-bindings).
- further think how to make the modified version.

# progression
- made the "cgal-swig-bindings", which is an optional pip package.

    Some discussion: 
    - name shoulde be either "cgal-swig-bindings" or "cgal_swig_bindings"?
    - did not find "cgal-bindings" file in repology.

- cgal-bindings forks from cgal-swig-bindings, but did not be updated for 2 years.
