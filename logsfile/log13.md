# So far


# Understanding
- The difference between C and python is that C has many data types whereas python only has one object.
- 
- swig is a thing that helps the programmer to automatically generate binding codes.

# Points
src := system resource controller

library := A library is a collection of implementations of behavior, written in terms of a language, \
that has a well-defined interface by which behavior is invoked. 

Static libraries are incorporated into a program executable before the program is run.

Shared libraries(.so/.dylib) are loaded at program start-up and may be shared by different programs.

Dynamically loaded libraries are loaded while the executable is running.
